## Hi there: 👋

I'm Carmen, a passionate and driven student at Belgium Campus iTversity, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I enjoy exploring how technology can solve real-world problems and am constantly expanding my skills in both software and system development.

-  🔭 I’m currently not working on a specific project. Still, I’m actively sharpening my skills and contributing to collaborative academic projects, especially those involving IoT, cloud computing, and data-driven web applications.

-  🌱 I’m currently learning more about Node.js, MongoDB, RESTful APIs, and machine learning concepts. I’m also expanding my understanding of DevOps practices and version control with Git & GitHub.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, academic research, and educational software that promote innovation and community impact.

- 💬 Ask me about software engineering best practices, cloud computing challenges, or building educational tools with code

- ⚡ Fun fact: I’ve worked on a joint hydroponics and aquaponics system with students from Penn State University, developing the software infrastructure side using Node-RED and web technologies.
